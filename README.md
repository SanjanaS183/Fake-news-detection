   Given data consisting of real and fake news with labels, a machine learning model is built for text classification. The data is read from the tsv file and labels are converted according to the label map. Then the data is preprocessed and split into tokens. Feature vectorisation is then done and a weight is assigned according to the occurrence of the word. Next the dataset is split to training and testing data according the percentage of split. After that cross validation is done, where the data is split in ten folds. Using an appropriate index in a loop, the train and validation data are assigned. Train data is trained using support vector algorithm. The labels for the validation data are predicted using the classifier. Then the accuracy is calculated and a confusion matrix is plotted. Finally, the classifier is used to predict the labels for the test data.
